# Thinking Gallery

Thinking Gallery is a coding test project I build which showcases creativity and raw JavaScript, CSS and HTML knowledge in order to build an image gallery.

## Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm run build` command first compiles the application, while `npm run watch` will compile and server for file changes.
